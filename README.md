# Enhanced Contact Us Feature

Enhances communication, gathers feedback, and fosters customer engagement.

Magento/Adobe Commerce have a contact-us module with limited functionality. They only offer a facility in which customers can leave comments and the administrator will receive an email. This module expands this feature by allowing administrators to track all client requests.

- Admin grid to see all the request submitted by customers.
- Download the records and manage offline.
